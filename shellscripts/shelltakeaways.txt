TAKEAWAYS:

1. If you are using the Arithmetic expansion syntax, then $((i+1)) will also work, 
there is no need to add the dollar sign with any variable inside the double parenthesis

2. $arr of any array will return the value of the first element, if no index is specified the first index is
taken to be default. Thus always use brace expansion like ${arr[$i]} before accessing elements of the array.

10-12-22:
1. While passing a filename to grep NEVER use single quotes around file name, single quotes eliminate all types of expansions.
2. Ideally, double quotes must be used around filenames to prevent spaces and tabs to be treated as delimiters and retain the actual filename.
3. Not using any quotes will cause the shell to treat spaces and tabs as delimiters.

1. To create good looking tables in the output use the printf function as follows:
			FORMAT STRING		LIST OF INDIVIDUAL VARS	    REDIRECT TO FILE
	printf "%-10s %-20s %-20s %-10s\n" "$var1" "$var2" "$var3" "$var4" >> filename // if redirection is intended
		Here:
			- means left aligned
			the numbers 10 and 20 specify the size of a field as number of spaces
			%s means a string quantity
			format specifiers can be used in the format string
	This prints the variables in fixed sized fields so that things look uniform :)
2. The special shell varable $? stores the return value of grep, if it is non-zero , grep did not find anything

1.Logic behind famous algorithms:
	Perfect Numbers: A positive integer equal to the sum of its' positive divisors excluding itself
		Eg. 28 = 1+2+4+7+14
	Krishnamurty Numbers: A positive number whose sum of factorial of each digit is equal to the number itself.
		Eg. 145 = 1!+4!+5! = 1 + 24 + 120 
	Armstrong Numbers: A positive number whose sum of digits raised to the power of number of digits is equal to the number itself.
		Eg. 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256

In The Pascal triangle code: 
1. The huge space overhead - why 
2.The printing format
3.why it is printing only odd no of lines

1.-gt,-lt,-ge,-le,-eq are used to compare integer values
   >,<,>=,<=,= are used to compare string values
   Interchanging them will cause havoc, since strings are compared digit by digit and integers are compared as a whole.
