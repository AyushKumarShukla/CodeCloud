This sensation is here to detract you from the path towards god.
This is not the first or last time it has come,
It has come in the past and will continue to come in the future
It is YOUR duty to tell your mind, that the attraction it is getting from the objects
is a false sensation created by maya, it is not real, it does not represent a true fact.
You need to handle these things like a yogi, the feeling is not real, it does not mean anything,
you need to practice getting your mind go towards god, if it runs back, bring it back agaon.
