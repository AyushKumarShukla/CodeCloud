					<td>Alan Turing</td>
					<td>The concept of the Turing machine was one of the first theoretical models of a general purpose computing machine, Alan Turing , along with the development of the Turing machine also gave notions about concepts of algorithms and computer programs.He presented the "Halting Problem" which he Mathematically proved that if a machine is instructed to execute a series of yes/no(Boolean) computations,it is uncertain whether the machine will ever halt. These concepts that Alan turing propelled forward,were later implemented practically and our current models of Computers are largely influenced by them </td>

					<td>John Von Neumann</td>
					<td>Jon Neumann made major contributions to many fields, including mathematics (mathematical logic, measure theory, functional analysis, group theory, lattice theory, representation theory, operator algebras, matrix theory, geometry, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics & ballistics, nuclear physics and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory and general equilibrium theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, numerical meteorology, scientific computing, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.He gave the architecture of a general purpose basic computer which had the most striking propery of the stored program concept, a computer which could fetch instructions and data one by one from a memory unit and perform computations based upon the instructions fetched.This is the very architecture that every single microprocessor largely uses with various modifications.</td>

					<td>Donald E Knuth</td>
					<td>He was the flag bearer of the propagation of asymptotic notations and computational complexity of algorithms, he also created the TEX typesetting platform and is currently working on a series of books under the title "The Art Of Programming" in which he aims to describe all the crucial core concepts of Computer Science in a concise manner.He has also been awarded with the ACM Turing award, the highest token of honor among Computer Science Laureates.He was also a professor of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</td>
					<td>Algorithms</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Dennis Ritchie</td>
					<td>Dennis Ritchie was the creator of the C programming language which is a founding pillar of the world of programming, his creation is used everywhere today, from the operating systems to the everyday applications we use.He also contributed greatly to the development of the UNIX operating system which today is used in various forms as LINUX distros and MAC OSX, these operating systems are a backbone of the internet.In 1983, Dennis Ritchie and his colleage Ken Thompson received the Turing Award "for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system"</td>
